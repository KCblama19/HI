### What I learned

It was a bit intimidating how small project like this took most of my mind power, the reason being, I haven't code with HTML and CSS for over a year or two and I have to recap and do some researches to get things in order.(It was amazing, going back to old resources).

Overall it was amazing, thanks to frontend Mentor

I'm looking forward to mastering the advanced concepts when it come to Responsive Website, Web app and media queries
